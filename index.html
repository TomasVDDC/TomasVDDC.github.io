      [Scene: A bustling pub. John, a suave and affluent man in his 30s, and
      Bob, an inventive, relaxed guy in his 50s, are deep in conversation over
      beers.]

      "How so?"
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <div class="character">Bob:</div>
      "I'm convinced I can create a remarkable movie with a minimal budget. It's
      not just about lavish sets and star-studded casts."

    <div class="dialogue">
      <div class="character">John: (laughs)</div>

    <h2>The Data Driven Approach to John and Bob's Challenge</h2>

    <div>
      To answer which approach is better, we will look at the data from the
      films in the TMBD database. The TMBD database contains information on over
      45,000 movies, including budget, revenue, and popularity. We will use this
      data to compare the performance of high-budget and low-budget films.
    </div>

    <h3>Defining Performance</h3>

    <div>
      To compare the performance of high-budget and low-budget films, we will
      consider the multiplier between the budget and the boxoffice. A 10x
      multiplier would imply that every dollar spent on the movie resulted in 10
      dollars in box office revenue.
    </div>

    <h3>Let's look at the data</h3>

    <div>
      After cleaning and filtering the data, we are left with 2657 movies. 1308
      high budget movies and 846 low budget movies. Given the definition of
      performance above let take a look at the distribution of the multiplier
      for both high and low budget movies.
    </div>

    <img
      src="./assets/img/LowHighComparaison.png"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; display: block"
    />

    <div>
      Low-budget movies, in blue, typically yield more modest returns, but a
      select few outperform expectations with high profitability. High-budget
      films, in orange, show more consistent returns but fewer breakout
      financial successes.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Movie Genre</h4>

    <div>
      Let's look at the distribution of genres for both high and low budget
      movies.
    </div>

    {% include plots/pie_genre.html %}

    <div>
      The most popular genre are completely different for high and low budget.
      High budget top 5 genre are: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama and
      Thriller. Low budget top 5 genre are: Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Horror and
      Romance. The biggest difference exists in Horrow where only 1.42% of high
      budget movies are in this genre compared to 9.5% for low budget movies.
      Let's try and understand why this is the case.
    </div>

    {% include plots/genre_influence_multiplier.html %}

    <div>
      We can explain the difference in the amount of horror films in low budget
      compared to high budget by looking at the multiplier difference. On
      average multiplier for horror films is 9.11 for low budget and 2.49 for
      high budget. This means that low budget horror films return on investement
      multiplier is at least 3x greater than any other genre of high budget
      films. We can hypothesize that this financial incentive is what drives the
      difference in the amount of horror films in low budget compared to high
      budget.
    </div>

    <h4>Movie Runtime</h4>

    <div>
      The Movie Runtime is the duration of the movie in minutes. Let's explore
      the distribution of runtime for both high and low budget movies and it's
      relation to the multiplier.
    </div>

    {% include plots/multiplier_by_runtime.html %}

    <div>
      The scatter plot compares the financial multiplier against the runtime for
      high (red) and low (blue) budget films. Most films cluster around the
      90-120 minute mark, reflecting a standard movie length. High-budget films
      show some outliers with high multipliers and longer runtimes, suggesting
      blockbuster potential for epic-scale movies. Low-budget films also have
      outliers with high multipliers, indicating potential sleeper hits. Both
      high and low-budget categories show a wide scatter, implying that runtime
      alone is not a strong predictor of financial success. Overall, while there
      are high-performing movies at various lengths, the majority of films from
      both budget categories tend to have moderate runtimes and multipliers.
      This suggests that factors other than runtime may may be important in
      determining a movie's financial performance.
    </div>

    <h4>Actor's age and sex</h4>

    {% include plots/multiplier_actors_age.html %} {% include
    plots/multiplier_actors_male_ratio.html %}

    <div>
      The first scatter plot explores the relationship between a film's
      financial multiplier and average actor's age. Low budget movies tend to
      have younger actors, probably because young and unexperienced actors are
      less expensive. The age doesn't consistently yield higher or lower returns
      for either budget category. In the second scatter plot, examining the
      multiplier against the male ratio within the cast, a similar pattern
      emerges: there's no discernible trend that a higher proportion of male
      actors correlates with financial success. Both high and low-budget films
      are dispersed throughout the plots, suggesting that the age and gender
      composition of the cast have a minimal direct impact on a movie's return
      on investment. This data implies that casting decisions regarding age and
      gender are likely based on creative rather than financial considerations.
      In our analysis, we will use other features related to the actor's age :
      the ratio of young (below 18 years old) and old (above 60 years old)
      actors in the movie, as well as the minimum and maximum age in each movie.
    </div>

    <h4>Actor's experience and popularity</h4>

    {% include plots/multiplier_actors_experience.html %} {% include
    plots/multiplier_actors_popularity.html %}
    <div>
      Those scatter plots compare the multiplier against the average actor's
      experience and popularity. The actor's mean experience is calculated by
      averaging over all actors in the movie, the number of films the actors
      have appeared before. Low budget movies tend to have less experienced and
      popular actors compared to high budget movies. For high budget movies, a
      high actor's experience seems to have a positive impact on the multiplier.
      For low budget movies, the multiplier shows more variability depending on
      actor's experience. We will also include in our analysis the minimum and
      maximum actor's experience and popularity, as well as the total number of
      characters.
    </div>

    <h4>Spoken languages count</h4>

    {% include plots/multiplier_languages.html %}
    <div>
      A higher number of spoken languages in a movie seems to induce lower
      multipliers for both low and high budget movies.Our analysis will also
      include other features : the original language and countries of
      production, the title word count and the quarter when the movie was
      released.
    </div>

    <h4>Initial Overall Perception</h4>

    <div>
      Low-budget films exhibit a greater variance in financial returns,
      indicating a higher risk but also the potential for significant profit, as
      seen in the broader spread of multipliers. In contrast, high-budget movies
      show more predictable returns, suggesting a lower risk but also a lower
      relative profitability. Genre preferences differ distinctly between the
      two, with low-budget films favoring genres like Horror that offer high
      returns at lower costs. Although movie runtime does not strongly correlate
      with financial success, both high and low-budget films typically adhere to
      standard feature-length times. This data implies that while high-budget
      films offer stability, low-budget films provide the allure of high
      rewards, driving diverse production strategies in the film industry.
      However we only looked at the data from a high level. Let's dive deeper
      into the data and see if we can find more insights. What are the most
      important features that drive the multiplier?
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>
    Which features of a movie have a significant effect on its multiplier?
  </h2>
  <div>
    Let's now dive into the statistical analysis of the data, and more
    especially into regressions. These simple but nevertheless powerful models
    will help us to make our predictions for our two protagonists, and to better
    understand which features are significant and essential to create the most
    profitable movie possible according to their respective budget. After
    applying min-max scaling to our features and a log transformation to the
    multiplier output, we performed a linear regression to determine the
    features with more significance. Here are the plots representing the
    resulting coefficients of the regression for both low and high budget
    movies.
  </div>

  {% include plots/predictors_high.html %}{% include plots/predictors_low.html
  %}

  <div>
    By keeping only features that exhibit clear positive or negative
    correlations with the output, that are in the 68% confidence interval and
    adding their interactions terms, we obtain the following most significant
    features.
  </div>
  {% include plots/significance_high.html %}{% include
  plots/significance_low.html %}

  <div>
    The key features influencing the multiplier differ between low and high
    budget movies. This indicates that each category follows distinct guidelines
    for optimizing their multipliers. We can also see that high budget films
    exhibit fewer significant features, simplifying the decision-making process
    for a high budget producer in selecting the movie features. Some important
    features are common in both categories : the movie runtime, genres and
    production countries. However, an interesting fact is that the most
    significant genres and production countries are not the same for high and
    low budget movies. The multiplier of low budget movies is also dependent on
    the title word count, the minimum actor's experience and average popularity,
    and the minimum age. This also suggests a higher variance in the multiplier
    for low budget movies. Knowing the significant features, we can now focus on
    optimizing them to achieve the highest possible multiplier.
  </div>
  <h2>How to maximize the movies multipliers in high and low budget movies?</h2>
  <div>
    Now that we know the important features for our producers, the next question
    is: How should they use them? This is where we can help. They already know
    which features matter, but now they need to figure out what values to
    choose. We'll guide them in picking the best values for these features. We
    did an optimization and we will try to give them the best advice!
  </div>

  <h2>High budget movies optimal features</h2>
  <div>
    In high budget movies, the maximum multiplier we can obtain using the most
    significant features is arount 20. The table below shows the advised
    features to obtain it. This could help John make the best choices for his
    movie.
  </div>

  {% include plots/optimal_table.html %}

  <div>
    The optimal runtime is around 190 min, and the producer should favors a
    movie with multiple spoken languages (around 11). The genres he should try
    are science fiction, crime or a combinaison of crime and fantasy, and he
    should avoid westerns. In theory, the movie production countries should be
    Japan, India and Canada, but this may not be applicable in this situation.
  </div>

  <h2>Low budget movies optimal features</h2>

  <div>
    By doing the same strategy than for high budget movies, the maximum value of
    the multiplier is above 4000, which is not realistic.
  </div>

  {% include plots/correlation_low.html %}

  <div>
    We can still recommend to Bob to produce an animation movie appears to be a
    favorable choice, as the animation genre is among the top positively
    correlated features. The genre that he has to avoid are drama,
    science-fiction, fantasy, or action given the significant negative
    correlation with the multiplier. But we are not sure about the others
    aspects of the movie. Helping low-budget movie producers remains challenging
    because low-budget movies vary significantly. Finding a clear trend in
    selecting features becomes hard, and the choice may seem somewhat random.
  </div>

  <h2>High vs. Low Budget Movies: Which Strategy Pays Off?</h2>

  <div>
    Finally, we performed a Mann-Whitney test to determine which category has
    the highest multiplier. We discovered that the distribution of multipliers
    for low-budget movies is greater than the distribution of multiplier for
    high-budget movies. However, if we try to predict which movie features to
    take in order to maximize the multiplier in low budget movies, it doesn't
    work. Making a low budget movie is riskier : you may have a very big return
    on investment, but the recipe to do so is unknown. One advise we could give
    to Bob is to try horror movies, as from our data visualisation it seems to
    be the genre producing the higher multiplier for low budget movies. Another
    option is an animation movie as there is a positive correlation with the
    multiplier. Making a high budget movie is safer, as we could determine which
    parameters to take to have the maximum multiplier. The important parameters
    are the runtime, the spoken languages count, the genre and the production
    country. John should go for a science fiction or crime movie (can be
    combinated with fantasy), 190 min long with 11 languages spoken. It is
    therefore hard to tell who between John and Bob is going to make the higher
    profit and win the bet, but Bob is definitely a bolder player!
